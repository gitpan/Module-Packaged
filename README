NAME
    Module::Packaged - Report upon packages of CPAN distributions

SYNOPSIS
      use Module::Packages;

      my $p = Module::Packaged->new();
      my $dists = $p->check('Archive-Tar');
      # $dists is now:
      # {
      # cpan    => '1.08',
      # debian  => '1.03',
      # fedora  => '0.22',
      # freebsd => '1.07',
      # gentoo  => '1.05',
      # openbsd => '0.22',
      # suse    => '0.23',
      # }

      # meaning that Archive-Tar is at version 1.08 on CPAN but only at
      # version 1.07 on FreeBSD, version 1.05 on Gentoo, version 1.03 on
      # Debian, version 0.23 on SUSE and version 0.22 on OpenBSD

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN consists of distributions. However, CPAN is not an isolated system
    - distributions are also packaged in other places, such as for operating
    systems. This module reports whether CPAN distributions are packaged for
    various operating systems, and which version they have.

    Note: only CPAN, Debian, Fedora, FreeBSD, Gentoo, Mandrake, OpenBSD and
    SUSE are currently supported. I want to support everything else. Patches
    are welcome.

METHODS
  new()
    The new() method is a constructor:

      my $p = Module::Packaged->new();

  check()
    The check() method returns a hash reference. The keys are various
    distributions, the values the version number included:

      my $dists = $p->check('Archive-Tar');
