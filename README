NAME
    Module::Packaged - Report upon packages of CPAN distributions

SYNOPSIS
      use Module::Packages;

      my $p = Module::Packaged->new();
      my $dists = $p->check('Archive-Tar');
      # $dists is now {cpan => '1.07', gentoo => '1.03'}
      # meaning that Archive-Tar is at version 1.07 on CPAN
      # but only version 1.03 on Gentoo

DESCRIPTION
    CPAN consists of distributions. However, CPAN is not an isolated system
    - distributions are also packaged in other places, such as for operating
    systems. This module reports whether CPAN distributions are packaged for
    various operating systems, and which version they have.

    Note: only CPAN and Gentoo are currently supported. I want to support
    versions of Debian, FreeBSD, OpenBSD, PPM, and Redhat. Patches are
    welcome.
